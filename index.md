## Track Overview
Search engine results underpin many consequential decision making tasks. Examples include
people using search technologies to seek health advice online, or time-pressured clinicians
relying on search results to decide upon the best treatment/diagnosis/test for a patient.

A key problem when using search engines in order to complete such decision making tasks, is
whether users are able to discern authoritative from unreliable information and correct from
incorrect information. This problem is further exacerbated when the search occurs within
uncontrolled data collections, such as the web, where information can be unreliable, generally
misleading, too technical, and can lead to unfounded escalations (White&Horvitz, 2009).
Information from search engine results can significantly influence decisions, and research
shows that increasing the amount of incorrect information about a topic presented in a SERP
can impel users to take incorrect decisions (Pogacar et al, 2017). As noted in the SWIRL III
report (Culpepper et al., 2018), decision making with search engines is poorly understood, and
likewise, evaluation measures for these search tasks need to be developed and improved.

## Goals of the Track

This track aims to 
* Provide a venue for research on retrieval methods that promote better
decision making with search engines, and
* Develop new online and offline evaluation
methods to predict the decision making quality induced by search results.
